The project consists of building a tabletop ping-pong game with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game does not yet have support for connecting two players on different clients, so both players must be on the same device to play together.


Game Interface and Gameplay

Game Rules
At the beginning of the game, both players must agree on the number of points needed to win. The winner will be the player who reaches the determined score first.

During each round, the speed of the ball gradually increases to increase the difficulty and prevent the two players from reaching a stalemate. At the end of each round, that is, after someone scores a point, the speed is restored to its initial default value.
